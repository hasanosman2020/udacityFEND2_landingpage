# Landing Page - Front End Nano Degree @Udacity

1. **Author**

The landing page is created by Hasan Osman for the second project required by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) on its [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011#batBeacon669272058893
).


1. **Project Background**

	The aim of the project is to build a multi-section landing page which appends dynamically added data to the DOM and which creates an interactive navigational experience for the user by amending and modifying an otherwise static site.   
	
	
1. **Project Requirements**
	
	The starter code consists of the index.html, the CSS and the JavaScript. The bulk of the work is on creating the JavaScript document (*app.js*) and making it manipulate the DOM. The student is required to:
	
	
	* modify the Javascript file in order that the index.html is modified such that the navigation menu is dynamically built when data is appended to the DOM;
		
	* the section in the viewport and being viewed by the user is differentiated on the menu at the top of the page, such as being highlighted and/or having a border;
		
	* the user is able to experience the ssmooth scrolling of the document to the section which correpsonds to the menu item clicked by the user.
		
		I have also created a "Back To Top" tag/button which is clearly visible to the user and which they can click to scroll the screen back to the top of the page and the start of the document.
		
		
1. **Technology**
	* HTML
	* CSS
	* JavaScript
	
	The project requires a solid understanding and appreciation of the JavaScript language, the technical aspects of how it manipulates the DOM, and how it works with HTML and CSS in order to generate an interactive user experience. 

1. **Implementation**
	* Extra section added to the index.html.
	* Smooth scrolling to relevant section on clicking from the navbar.
	* Adding active class to the navbar link whose corresponding section is visible in the viewport and highlighting such link when active class is activated. 
	* Adding a "Back To Top" tag/button which scrolls the page back to the top when clicked on.
